    Rules:
    1. If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values to the larger of the
    two
    data types
    2. If one of the values is integral and the other is a floating point, Java will promote the int to float
    3. smaller data types (byte, short, char) are promoted to int if they are used with an arithmetic operator
    4. After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting value will have the same
    data type as its promoted operands
