    basics:

    1. bytecode
    2. c. be careful of stuff inside the /* to throw you off. if it has the things, its good to go
    3. check to make sure you are in the right directory
    4. public static void main(String[] args)
    5. public
    6. it takes a String array

    OOP Concepts
    1. methods and fields
    2. memory
    3. methods
    4. encapsulation
    5. class
    6. abstract class, class, extends   //Common behavior can be defined in a superclass and inherited into a subclass using the extends keyword.
    7. interface
    8.  //A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a package
    9. Application Programming Interface

    Variables:
    1. variable of an object (nonstatic)
    2. variable of a class (static)
